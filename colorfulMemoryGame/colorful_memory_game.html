<!-- The structure for a colorful memory match game including a title, "Colorful Memory Match Game," and a game elements container.

It has link tag to include CSS file in the HTML file.

Inside the container, there's a specific division <div> intended to hold dynamically generated cards using JavaScript, although the card generation code isn't present in this snippet.

Additionally, there's a section below the game container with a paragraph displaying the current score and a timer indicating the time left, initially set to 0 and 30 seconds, respectively. Finally, there's a button labeled "Start/Restart" <button> intended to initiate or reset the game when clicked.

To include the JavaScript file in colorful_memory_game.html, a script tag can be used above the </body> tag.-->
